This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) SaaS project that uses AI to generate customized weekly meal plans for users.
The project uses Stripe for payment, clerk for authentication and Meta: Llama 3.3 8B Instruct (free) AI for the meal plan generator.

This was done as a practice project to learn next.js

The app is deployed on vercel and can be found at [AI Meal Plan](https://aimealplan.store)
